# Smart Guide for a Blind Person
# Objective:
 To develop a real-time object detection and text detection application for visually impaired individuals with voice feedback and multi-language support.
# Technologies:
Object Detection: YOLO (YOLOv3, YOLOv4)
Text Detection: EasyOCR
Voice Feedback: gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) with multi-language support
Speech Recognition: Google Speech API for controlling the app via voice commands
Web Framework: Streamlit (web interface) and Flask (alternative for certain functionalities)

# Key Features
Object Detection: Detects objects in real-time using YOLO models.
Text Detection: Detects text in images using EasyOCR.
Voice Commands: Control the app using voice commands such as “start”, “stop”, and “upload video”.
Multi-language Support: Voice feedback in multiple languages, including English, Hindi, Bengali, and Odia.
Webcam & Image Upload: Supports real-time webcam input, uploaded images, and videos for object and text detection.
Design Enhancements:
Custom-styled buttons, background image from the ‘ojt’ folder, and a card-style layout with centered content.
A small window for real-time display of voice commands with animations.
